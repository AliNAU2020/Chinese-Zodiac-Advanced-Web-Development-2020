<p>The Chinese Zodiac is based on twelve-year cycle based on an animal sign. Chinese Zodiac is also
known Sheng Xiao.There are twelve signs based on an animal sign such as ox, rat, tiger, rabbit, dragon,
snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig, according to Chinese lunar calendar.The Chinese Zodiac
comes back from a Chinese legend, Jade Emperor, who was a legend ruler of heavens, asked all animals to participate on his birthday by holding 
a race between the animals. </p></br>
<p>The rat and cat from the twelve Chinese Zodiac animals were the neighbors at that time. The cat and rat became rivals
as the cat always bullied the rat, leading the rat to swallow anger.To take revenge on the cat, the rat went early without waking up the cat as told
by the cat to wake him up.The cat was not included in twelve animals heaven group unfortunately, as he came to heaven one day later.The animals arrived in heaven in order by rat riding on the ox to cross the river,
followed by tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and finally pig arriving just in time to receive the last place after the race over there at Jade Emperor's place.
Actually, the Chinese Zodiac origin came around the Han Dynasty and it is based on Chinese astrology and used as a way to count years, months, weeks and days of the calendar. </p>
